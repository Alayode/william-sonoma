Welcome to the Williams-Sonoma Markup 

Refer to the image titled "markup-challenge.jpg” while putting your page together. Feel free to use the images provided, or use your own optimized images. Dazzle us with your HTML / CSS and JavaScript skills by:

	•	Using the small product images to update the large hero product image.
	•	Expanding and collapsing the sections on the lower right quadrant of the page.
	•	Display a modal or message after the Add to Cart button is clicked.

If your markup challenge submission requires extra steps to be viewed (rather than just dragging an html file onto a browser window), please consider adding a few notes describing the process. Spend as long, or as little, time as you see fit.

We are looking forward to receiving your Markup Challenge submission.

Thank you!
